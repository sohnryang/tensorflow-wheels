# TensorFlow-Wheels

The TensorFlow wheels built by myself.

If you are using computer similar to mine, you can use these wheels.

## My computer setup

I'm using MacBook Pro 15-inch Mid 2015.

### CPU

Intel Core i7-4770HQ @ 2.20GHz

CPU features for optimization: SSE4.1, SSE4.1, AVX, AVX2, FMA

> *Note: My computer supports Intel's MKL, so linux wheels are optimzed with MKL. On the other hand, macOS wheels is not built with MKL support but I will optimize with it when TensorFlow supports MKL on macOS.*

### GPU

My only GPU is Intel Iris Pro. As you may know, this doesn't support CUDA, but it supports OpenCL. I'll build wheels with OpenCL when TensorFlow's OpenCL support is stablized and when I have time & mental force to build a kernel.

## Linux wheels

| Version | Build command |
| ------- | ------------- |
| v1.4.1  | `bazel build --config=opt --config=mkl --copt=-mavx --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-msse4.1 --copt=-msse4.2 --copt=-mfma //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package` |

## macOS wheels

Coming soon!

## How to download & install

You can download wheel files from the repository directly. There's a [release page](https://github.com/sohnryang/tensorflow-wheels/releases) that makes you find appropriate version for you.
